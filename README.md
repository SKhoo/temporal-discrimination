# Temporal Discrimination
Med-PC programs for running a temporal discrimination paradigm.

## TD1 Temporal Discrimination

This program can run temporal discrimination sessions where cues are presented with varying lengths between a short cue and a long cue. The short cue is associated with one manipulanda while the long cue is associated with the other - after presentation of the cue, a correct response will result in reinforcer delivery. For sessions with intermediate cue lengths, they are reinforced based on whether they are closer in duration to the short cue or the long cue (precisely intermediate cues are randomly treated as short or long cues). A percentage of trials can also be forced in where the manipulanda have extended availability and incorrect responses are ignored but do not trigger the end of the trial.
